[nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nan) (C) - A terminal file manager, similar to ranger. It allows you to navigate directories, manipulate files, analyze disk usage, and fuzzy open files.  
[ncdu](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu) (C) - ncurses disk analyzer. Similar to du -sh, but allows for directory navigation as well.  
[z.lua](https://github.com/skywind3000/z.lua) (Lua) - It's an alternative to the z utility mentioned in the article. I haven't done the benchmarks, but they claim to be faster than z. I'm mostly just including it because it's what I use.
