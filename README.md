#### APIs
[Microsoft REST API guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/master/Guidelines.md)

Every single person writing a REST api should have to memorize this table:

GET - Return the current value of an object, is idempotent;  
PUT - Replace an object, or create a named object, when applicable, is idempotent;  
DELETE - Delete an object, is idempotent;  
POST - Create a new object based on the data provided, or submit a command, NOT idempotent;  
HEAD - Return metadata of an object for a GET response. Resources that support the GET method MAY support the HEAD method as well, is idempotent;  
PATCH - Apply a partial update to an object, NOT idempotent;  
OPTIONS - Get information about a request, is idempotent.  
Most importantly, that PUT is idempotent.

Although people around the world are becoming increasingly aware of the United States' global geography of surveillance, covert action, and other secret programs, much of this landscape is invisible in our everyday lives.

NOTHING TO HIDE (2017) is an independent documentary dealing with surveillance and its acceptance by the general public through the "I have nothing to hide" argument.
