#### APIs
[Microsoft REST API guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/master/Guidelines.md)

Every single person writing a REST api should have to memorize this table:

GET - Return the current value of an object, is idempotent;  
PUT - Replace an object, or create a named object, when applicable, is idempotent;  
DELETE - Delete an object, is idempotent;  
POST - Create a new object based on the data provided, or submit a command, NOT idempotent;  
HEAD - Return metadata of an object for a GET response. Resources that support the GET method MAY support the HEAD method as well, is idempotent;  
PATCH - Apply a partial update to an object, NOT idempotent;  
OPTIONS - Get information about a request, is idempotent.  
Most importantly, that PUT is idempotent.
