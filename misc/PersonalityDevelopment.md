1. Put aside perfectionism  
One of the biggest blockers for effective decision-making.  
Operates on faulty all-or-nothing thinking.  
Trying to weigh every possible outcome is paralyzing.  

2. Right-size the problem  
What goals, priorties or people will be impacted?  
Helps differentiate between what's meaningful and what's not worth.  
Try the 10/10/10 test.  
How you'll feel about the decision 10 weeks, months or years from now?
It's likely the choice will be inconsequential.  

3. Leverage the underestimated power of intuition  
The brain considers a situation, quickly assesses all your experiences, and then makes the best decision given the context.  
This automatic process is faster than rational thought, which means intuition is a necessary decision-making tool when time is short and traditional data is not available.  
Pairing intuition with analytical thinking helps make better, faster and more accurate decisions.  

4. Limit the drain of decision fatigue  
Hundreds of decision a day - from what to eat for breakfast to how to respond to an email - each depletes your mental and emotional resources.  
More likely to over think when drained, so the more you can eliminate minor decisions, more energy for ones that really matter.  
Look for opportunities to eliminate certain decsions altogether - by best practices, standardized protocols, delegation or removing yourself (from meetings).  

5. Construct creative constraints  
Parkinson's law - work expands to the time we allow it. If you give yourself one month to create a presentation, it will take one full month for it. If you only had a week, it will be finished in shorter time.  

Creating accountability through creative constraints.  
ex: determine a date or time by which you'll make a choice.
