- [Bystander effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect)  
The bystander effect is a social psychological theory that states that individuals are less likely to offer help to a victim when there are other people present; the greater the number of bystanders, the less likely it is that one of them will help.   
Several factors contribute to the bystander effect, including ambiguity, group cohesiveness, and diffusion of responsibility that reinforces mutual denial of a situation's severity. (From _Wikipedia_)
