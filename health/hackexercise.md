**Hacking:** computer term that refers to specialized knowledge applied by an expert to overcome a problem  
**Strength Building /Resistance Training:** exercise that improves muscular strength and endurance like lifting weights  
**Cardiorespiratory Fitness:** capacity of the body to transport and utilize oxygen  

**Cardiorespiratory Fitness:** capacity of the body to transport and utilize oxygen  
**Musculoskeletal Fitness:** fitness that is developed when we overload our muscles  
**Overload:** demand placed on the muscle that is above normal (necessary to improve muscles strength, endurance and power)  
**Fatigue:** overloading the muscle repeatedly leads to inability to move or support the load  
**Progression:** gradual increase in workload or stress placed upon the body during exercise training  
**Muscle Fibre:** muscle adapts, adding a little bit more protein to the inside of the cell unit of a muscle  
**Hypertrophy:** small enlargements leading to muscles getting bigger  

**Exercise Continuum:** a concept to explain different responses to different types of exercise  
**Endurance:** the capacity to perform prolonged exercise  
**Ligaments:** bands of tough elastic tissue that connect bones and give support to joints  
**Endurance Training:** low-to moderate-intensity activity performed in a continuous manner with the goal of increasing the body’s capacity to use oxygen to produce energy  
**Resistance Training:** short duration, intense exercise, usually associated with building muscle strength (aka musculoskeletal fitness), encompasses everything from body-weight movements like push ups and heavy barbell squats   

**General Adaptation Syndrome:** theory regarding how the body responds to stress in a manner intended to reduce the disturbance the next time the same stress is experienced  
**Homeostasis:** body at rest, heart rate and breathing rate are relatively low and constant (good match between body's demand for energy and its capacity to supply it)  
**MuscleAtrophy:** happens when the rate of protein breakdown is greater than the rate of protein synthesis  
**Hypertrophy:** protein synthesis is greater than the protein breakdown   
**Selye’s General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS):** a concept put forward by Hans Selye that describes the response to stress, such as exercise, and recover to better be able to withstand the stress

**Physiology:** the study of living systems and how cells, tissues, and organisms function  
**Interval Training:** intermittent exercise involving alternating bouts of higher-intensity effort interspersed with periods of recovery  
**Norwegian Protocol:** an interval protocol characterized by four bouts of vigorous exercise, each lasting 4 minutes and separated by 3 minutes of lower-intensity exercise for recovery recovery  
**Musculoskeletal Strength:** the strength of the muscles, tendons, and bones that comprise our body  

**Cardiorespiratory Fitness:** capacity of the body to transport and utilize oxygen  
**Mitochondria:** cell powerhouse that uses oxygen to convert the energy stored in fuels such as sugars and fats into energy used to produce movement  
**VO2max:** maximal oxygen uptake   
**Rockport Walk Test:** method to estimate VO2 max  

**High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT):** a form of exercise involving alternating bouts of more intense effort with periods of recovery  
**BaselineFitness:** initial starting fitness level prior to exercise training   
**One Minute Workout:** intense interval exercise protocol involving 3 hard sprints of 20 seconds each    

**Performance Adaptation Switch:** theory proposed to explain how different types of exercise trigger physiological remodelling  
**Endurance Exercise:** moderate-intensity continuous exercise performed for a prolonged period of time  
**Type I Fibres:** slow twitch fibres that tend to be recruited for relatively easy movements that do not require a lot of force  
**Type II Fibres:** fast twitch fibres that tend to be recruited for powerful movements that require a lot of force.

**Metabolism:** sum of all chemical reactions in the body  
**Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption/After-burn:** transient period of elevated metabolism above resting level during recovery from exercise

**Systolic Blood Pressure:** pressure exerted on arterial vessel walls when the heart contracts 

**Sarcopenia:** slow loss of muscle and strength that occurs with aging

**Type I Fibres:** ‘slow twitch’ fibres, usually comprise about half the overall muscle tissue, recruited for relatively easy movements (i.e., lighter loads)   
**Type II Fibres:** ‘fast twitch’ fibres, are recruited for fast, powerful movements that require a lot of force  
**Contractile Protein:** protein inside the muscle fibre responsible for force generation   
**Hypertrophy:** muscle getting bigger in size in adulthood (i.e., growth outside of childhood growth)

**Percent of 1RM:** single repetition maximum (the load you can lift only once)  
**Low Force Contractions:** lifting loads that are at ~30-50% of your 1RM  
**High Force Contractions:** lifting loads that are at ~70-90% of your 1RM  
**NoobGains:** the gains made in strength and muscle mass that are seen early in a program of resistance training

**Macronutrient:** a broad group of food comprising carbohydrates, fats, and proteins   
**DietaryProtein:** composed of amino acids and can’t be stored in your body so it needs to be used for a protein-requiring process, commonly: eggs, meat, dairy foods, beans, peas, legumes, nuts  
**Muscle Protein Turnover:** the dynamic process of making muscle proteins and breaking them down  
**Muscle Protein Synthesis:** to build muscle   
**Muscle Protein Breakdown:** getting rid of damaged proteins, needs to happen to remove damage to keep muscle working well   
**Muscle Full Effect:** you can’t put more muscle protein into muscle  
**Maximize Muscle Protein Synthesis Formula:** 1.6 g protein/kg body weight/day, which if it were consumed as 3 meals per day would be ~0.5 g protein/kg body weight/meal  

**Pectoral:** chest muscle  
**Triceps:** muscles in the back of arms  
**Biceps:**  muscles in the front of arms   
**Trunk Muscles:** core, link between upper and lower body  
**Quads, Glutes and Calves:** muscles in legs   
**Fulcrum:** the point about which a joint moves (i.e. elbow, knee, hip) 

**FITT Principle (frequency, intensity, time and type):** a concept used to describe the essential characteristics of an exercise training intervention, in terms of the number of sessions (frequency), relative effort (intensity), duration (time) and mode of workout (type)  
**AminoAcids:** the building blocks of protein, 20 in total, 9 are essential (we need to eat them)   
**Sodium Bicarbonate:** a weak base that can react with acid produced in the body to neutralize the acid and potentially help performance  
**Nitrate:** a compound found naturally in certain plants with evidence to show it enhances exercise performance
